        <p>The annual flooding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile" target="_blank">Nile River</a>, and its connection to the star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius#Observational_history" target="_blank">Sirius</a> was of paramount importance during this era, and it is demonstrated how much of the mythology and symbolism of later Ages and cultures are actually derivations from this fundamental mythos - in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_goddess" target="_blank">Mother Goddess</a> was revered rather than vilified, as the case has subsequently become during the Ages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_age#The_Age_of_Aries_.28The_Arian_Age.29" target="_blank">Aries</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_age#The_Age_of_Pisces_.28The_Piscean_Age.29" target="_blank">Pisces</a>. As one example, it is postulated that the Biblical account of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man" target="_blank">“Fall of Humanity”</a> can be interpreted as a record in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3141837?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">astromythological</a> form of the usurpation of the ancient stellar and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchal_religion" target="_blank">matriarchal cosmology</a> – in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taweret" target="_blank">Great Mother</a> was preeminent – by the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta11.htm" target="_blank">solar</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4377665?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">patriarchal</a> regime in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah" target="_blank">Jehovah</a> became the central (i.e. only) diety. Although it is undeniable that our current Age is characterized by many aspects of a bellicose patriarchy, it is suggested that this is a regime losing its foothold, to be supplanted in the (relatively) near future with a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism" target="_blank">egalitarian</a> cosmology.</p>
