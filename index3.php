        <p>The ancient Egyptians were quite aware of the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession" target="_blank">precession</a> well before it was “discovered” by Greek astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus#Precession_of_the_equinoxes_.28146.E2.80.93127.C2.A0BC.29" target="_blank">Hipparchus</a> during the Hellenistic era. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html" target="_blank">recounts</a> how the Egyptian priests of the 7th century BCE maintained that they had knowledge of multiple precessional cycles (each one comprising 24-26,000 years; i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Year" target="_blank">Great Year</a>), and the concomitant periodic destruction of humanity through various celestial cataclysms – from which they were invariably saved due to their proximity to the Nile. This cycle is shown to have been recognized by ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_cosmology" target="_blank">Hindu cosmologists</a>, leading to their development of the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga" target="_blank">Yugas</a> - wherein each Yuga represents a portion of the <a href="http://www.thegreatyear.com/thegreatyear/index.shtml" target="_blank">Great Year</a>, with its own celestial characteristics that determine the relative level of spiritual advancement of humanity as a whole. This in part constitutes the so-called “Secret Doctrine” of <a href="http://hermetic.com/dionysos/beyond3.htm" target="_blank">Aeonic succession</a> throughout the course of the Great Year.</p>
