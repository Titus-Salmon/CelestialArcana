        <p>Titus Salmon holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Indiana University, Bloomington. He has studied the Tarot, astrology, and occult symbolism for over 20 years. His diverse interests have led to a variety of occupations, including biologist, drafter, illustrator, painter, and tattoo artist. A unifying element throughout his work has been an interest in the confluence of symbolism and esthetics in nature, art, science, and technology, and how meaning is assigned to the various elements in a picture or pattern. This book is the result of independent research, which has been necessitated by the nature of the subject at hand; as in the words of Arthur Waite: “there is no canon of authority in the interpretation of Tarot symbolism”.</p>
