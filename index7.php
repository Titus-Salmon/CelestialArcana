        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Arcana" target="_blank">Minor Arcana</a> and its relationship to the Major Arcana is discussed as well, and it is proposed that the two Arcana can be used as an astrological notation system in which any kind of chart (i.e., <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscope" target="_blank">natal</a>, <a href="http://www.kepler.edu/home/index.php/articles/using-astrology/item/330-solar-returns-part-i" target="_blank">progressed</a>, etc.)  may be constructed by utilizing specific combinations of the cards. It is postulated that much of the secrecy and taboo surrounding the Tarot originated from such a use during the Medieval Ages, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_astrology" target="_blank">prognosticative astrology</a> was forbidden under 
            threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition" target="_blank">Inquisition</a>. This theory does not discount the use of the Tarot for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarotology" target="_blank">divination</a> via the random drawing of cards, and a new “22-card spread” is provided (with illustrations) for this purpose.</p>

        <p>The book is illustrated with over 260 images consisting of tables, diagrams, and pictures. The bibliography, index, and references are quite thorough as well, with over 660 footnotes. Total word count = 99,929 (475 pages).
